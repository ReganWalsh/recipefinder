# *Recipe Finder*
An application where a user is able to search an API (food2fork) through a front-end interface for certain recipes they would like to obtain. Users have the ability to add certain recipes to their 'liked recipes' for later reference and easy callback. Users also have the ability to create a shopping list based upon ingredients in recipes. The front-end interface was implemented using HTML and CSS with the logic being provided using JavaScript.

## *To Run:*
Clone or download the repo and move into the project directory. To install the dependencies for the project run ```npm install``` and to run the application execute ```npm start```. The application then runs on ```localhost:8080```.

## *What I Learned:*

* Implementing Async/Await in JavaScript
* Creating an application using ES6 syntax and structure
* Implementing the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
* localStorage in JavaScript.
* External API integration.

_**Please ignore excessive comments within this Project. I use them as a way to learn when implementing a new project, as I find it improves my retention of programming language concepts and language syntax when they are used .**_ üññüèª
